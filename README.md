Everyone using Fusion 360 probably knows this error message: *“The selected rail dos not touch all of the profiles.”*
To avoid this when lofting eggshaped spans I am working on this tool.

### Here are the steps to get it run:
1. In Fusion 360 go to Utilities > ADD-INS > Skripts and Add-Ins.
2. Create a new script (chose Script, Python and airfoil_to_line as Script Name
3. Right click on the script > Open file location
4. Overwrite the script with the  script.
